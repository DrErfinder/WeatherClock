# Weather Clock 🌦️🕐
You have no idea what's the weather? With this Datapack a clock will tell you.

## How it works
* If select a clock in your hotbar, the current weather is displayed on screen.
* If you put a clock in an item frame, the current weather will be displayed if you look at it.

## Other Features
* Minimal impact on performance: Most commands are only executed on demand or every 5 seconds  
* Please note that due to this 👆 and how minecraft weather works it might take a few seconnds to update item frames.

## Installation ✔️
Download the latest release from the releases Section on Github or from Planet Minecraft and place the file `WeatherClock.zip` in your datapacks folder.

## Uninstallation ❌
Remove all clocks from item frames and delete the `AlwaysThunder.zip` from your datapacks folder.  
If you don't remove clocks from item frames the name (Sunny, Rain or Thunder) will stay in it after removal (The clock will still works as normal 😉).  
In case the can't go troh all itme frames with clocks (because, for example, you've installed it on a Server) you can install this Datapack:
